# Introduction

## Medical statistics

Medical statistics is the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions through the rigorous analysis of data. From clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of new treatments to observational studies exploring risk factors for diseases, statistical methods provide the tools necessary for designing studies, analyzing results, and drawing valid conclusions. In modern medicine, decision-making must be supported by data, and medical statistics ensures that these data are interpreted correctly.

## Data types

In statistics, data can be classified into different types based on various characteristics. Understanding these data types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods and accurately interpreting results. Below are the main types of data:

### Quantitative data

Quantitative data (numerical data) refers to data that can be measured and expressed numerically. This type of data is critical in the medical field as it allows for precise measurements, comparisons, and statistical analysis, ultimately leading to better understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Quantitative data can be further classified into two main types:

**1. Discrete data**

Discrete data consist of distinct, separate values that are countable. These values are typically whole numbers, and there is no intermediate value between them. The data are non-negative integers, as they represent counts of occurrences.

Examples:

Number of patients: The number of patients admitted to a hospital.

Number of medications: The number of medications a patient is taking.

Number of occurrences: The number of heartbeats per minute (heart rate).

**2. Continuous data**

Continuous data can take any value within a given range. These data represent measurements and can have decimal places, meaning they are not restricted to whole numbers.

Examples:

Blood pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements (e.g., 120/80 mmHg).

Body temperature: Body temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 36.6°C).

Cholesterol levels: Blood cholesterol levels measured in milligrams per deciliter (e.g., 180 mg/dL).

### **Categorical data**

Categorical data in medicine refers to non-numerical data that represent categories or groups. Unlike quantitative data, which deals with numbers and measurements, categorical data describes characteristics or attributes that can be used to classify individuals, objects, or events into distinct groups. This type of data is crucial in medical research and practice for understanding patient demographics, disease classifications, and treatment outcomes.

**1. Nominal data**

Nominal data consists of categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. These categories are mutually exclusive, meaning that an individual or event can belong to only one category.

Examples:

Blood type: Categories like A, B, AB, and O.

Gender: Male, Female, Other.

Presence or absence of a Condition: Yes/No responses (e.g., presence of hypertension).

**2. Ordinal data**

Ordinal data consists of categories that have a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal or meaningful.

Examples:

Severity of disease: Mild, Moderate, Severe.

Pain scale: Numeric rating scale (e.g., 0–10), where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.

Stage of cancer: Stages I, II, III, IV.
